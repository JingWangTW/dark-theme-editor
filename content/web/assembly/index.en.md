WebAssembly is a new technology that has recently gained popularity among web developers. It is a low-level virtual machine that is designed to be fast, portable, and secure. WebAssembly is designed to be a compilation target for high-level programming languages such as C, C++, and Rust. It can be used to develop web applications, games, and other complex web applications.

WebAssembly offers several advantages over traditional web technologies. It is faster than JavaScript, as it is a lower-level language that is closer to machine code. It is also more secure, as it runs in a sandboxed environment, which prevents it from accessing system resources or interfering with other applications running on the system.

# How WebAssembly Works

WebAssembly code is written in a language called WebAssembly Text Format (WAT). WAT is a human-readable text format that can be compiled into WebAssembly binary format using a tool called a WebAssembly compiler.

Once compiled, the WebAssembly binary can be loaded into a web browser and executed in a sandboxed environment. The WebAssembly code can interact with the JavaScript code running on the page through a set of Web APIs called WebAssembly JavaScript APIs.

# Conclusion

WebAssembly is a powerful new technology that offers several advantages over traditional web technologies. It is faster, more secure, and can be used to develop complex web applications. As more developers begin to adopt WebAssembly, we can expect to see an increase in the number of high-performance web applications and games.
