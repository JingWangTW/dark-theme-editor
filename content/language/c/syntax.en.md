# C Programming Language Syntax

## Basic Syntax
- Each line of C code is a statement that ends with a semicolon `;`
- Code is written in functions, which contain statements and expressions
- Comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`

## Variables
- Variables must be declared before they are used
- Declaration starts with the data type (e.g. int, char) followed by the variable name
- Multiple variables can be declared on the same line, separated by commas

## Control Flow
- Conditional statements: `if`, `else`, `switch`
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`

## Functions
- Functions must be declared before they are called
- A function declaration includes the return type, name, and parameters (if any)

## Pointers
- Pointers are used to store memory addresses
- The `*` operator is used to declare a pointer variable and to access the value of the variable it points to
- `&` operator is used to get the address of a variable
